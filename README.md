# StoryMapJS: Maps that tell stories.

[StoryMapJS](http://storymap.knightlab.com) is a simple tool to help you tell stories with maps. If you're not a programmer, you don't need to spend much time on the GitHub page—instead, go [StoryMapJS](http://storymap.knightlab.com)

If you want information on creating JSON with your own code and embedding it, see the ["Advanced"](http://storymap.knightlab.com/advanced.html) documentation on the StoryMap website.


## Development

 See DEVELOPMENT.md to get setup for local development of StoryMap.


## Contributing language translations

StoryMap's older sibling, [TimelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com) has proven internationally popular, in part because users have contributed translation support for dozens of languages.  StoryMap is also ready to be used in languages other than English, but once again, we'll need your help.

For each language, we need a simple file with a name like `*xx*.js`, where *xx* is the two letter code for the language. (Technically, it's the ISO 639-1 code—you can find a [list of them on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).) The file defines a Javascript object with language specific translations. To make one for your language, copy one of the existing files (like [this one for Spanish](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/blob/master/source/js/language/locale/es.js)) and edit the quoted strings. Please *don't* change the "keys"—the unquoted strings. If you know how to use GitHub to make a pull request, that's the best way to submit it to us. If that's not your thing, you can [add a comment to this support thread](https://knightlab.zendesk.com/entries/33066836-Help-us-translate-StoryMapJS-into-other-languages) and upload your translation as an attachment.


## GigaPixel

Images are rendered so when set to be map_as_image the entire image is shown. When set as cartography the zoom will set so that all the markers fit.

Points are set to only display on mouseover in image mode, but you can set map_as_image to false in the config options to always show the points. The points are hidden when the intent is an image so that nothing obstructs the image the viewer is looking at. Looking at a painting is hard with a bunch of points on it.
